                According to a recent UN report, the US <br> produces about 6.3 million tons or 14% of<br> the world’s electronic waste. Worldwide, almost <br>45 million tons of electronics were tossed out in 2016. <br> 
                <br>
                ...only 20% of that has been recycled. dang

                When extracting minerals methods<br> used are almost always improper <br>— in some places, for example, gold <br>is recovered by bathing circuit boards<br> in nitric and hydrochloric acid, poisoning <br>waterways, and after, whatever is not<br> used is dumped in the ground improperly<br> anyway. The current rate of responsible <br>e-waste recycling is at an abysmal<br> 15.5% worldwide.
