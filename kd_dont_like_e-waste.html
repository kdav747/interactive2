                According to a recent UN report, the US <br> produces about 6.3 million tons or 14% of<br> the world’s electronic waste. Worldwide, almost <br>45 million tons of electronics were tossed out in 2016. <br> 
                <br>
                ...only 20% of that has been recycled. dang

                When extracting minerals methods<br> used are almost always improper <br>— in some places, for example, gold <br>is recovered by bathing circuit boards<br> in nitric and hydrochloric acid, poisoning <br>waterways, and after, whatever is not<br> used is dumped in the ground improperly<br> anyway. The current rate of responsible <br>e-waste recycling is at an abysmal<br> 15.5% worldwide.

            Mass consumerism and planned obsolescence outweighs recycling efforts<br>

            Clearly, the problem is overconsumption<br>

            Increasing our efforts to extend the lives<br> of devices, keeping them out of <br>landfills, and giving them second<br> and third lives, seems to be the most<br> practical and intelligent approach.<br>

            Lawmakers in parts of Europe and<br> Canada and in some U.S. states<br> have passed so-called Extended<br> Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws, which<br> require manufacturers to establish<br> and fund systems to recycle or collect<br> obsolete products.
